Will was a very nice boy. One day, he came across a pig.

The pig was git-ting fat. He was eating a lot of pig pellets. Why was it doing so? No one knows.

He continued on his adventure! Next, he came across a giraffe.

The giraffe was eating leaves. He was also git-ting fat! Now we will have a fat pig and a fat giraffe.

Finally, Will went home and fell asleep.

Or did he? He woke up. He was still in the Upside Down.

"When will I ever get out of here?", he wondered.
